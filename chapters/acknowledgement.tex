\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
This is a Masters's thesis at Ulm university written at \textit{Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati} (SISSA) in Trieste at the mathLab department.

I want to thank Prof. Dr. Karsten Urban for providing contact to  Prof. Dr. Gianluigi Rozza, which made it possible to write the master thesis in Italy.

And I want to thank Prof. Dr. GianIluigi Rozza for welcoming me at SISSA.
I also want to thank him for moving me to a new office because of a nerve-wrecking sound that appeared after a few weeks at the first office.

A special thanks to my supervisor Nicola Demo for always taking time to listen and help me with any problem.
He continuously supported me and gave me good advice in my process of working on my thesis.
And thanks for teaching me how to play briscola after lunch.

Towards the end of my stay in Italy, I was confronted with challenges that came up with the coronavirus pandemic.
I was disappointed that the coronavirus forced me to leave earlier as planned.
But because I had to leave on short notice, I had to leave some of my things behind, which I am not particularly sad about since it gives me a reason to come back soon.
